# Stupid Simple React Seed
### Another Simple React Seed
Another react project seed with simple tooling and bare-bones configuration annotated heavily for learning React and useful for prototyping spikes or very small, focused apps. Includes:
* Axios
* Classnames
* Styled JSX
* Jest
* Enzyme

with basic, easily-decipherable configuration for Webpack and Babel. Intented mostly for prototyping or small applications, it uses an application wrapper component rendered directly to the DOM that acts as a state container for other, stateless components.

## QuickStart:
1. Run ```npm i```
1. Run ```npm run start```

## Scripts:
Transpile and bundle: 
```
npm run build
```

Watch for file changes and bundle:
```
npm run watch
```

Start local app instance:
```
npm run start
```
